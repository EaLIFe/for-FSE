Overview
--------
    The web application has a simple interface with a single button 
    [Upload and GO]. Our scientists upload a plain text file 
    containing gene expression levels from two samples, representing 
    two experimental conditions. Accepting the file, the software
    will return a table of differentially expressed genes 
    and a scatter plot of these genes whose X-axis is control 
    and Y-axis is treatment. If an invalid gene expression is given, 
    the web application returns a page informing the user to provide 
    the correct format.
